HW2

Problem #1

(a) README.md - unmodified
(b) README.md - modified
	fun_problem.txt - unmodified
(c) README.md - staged
	fun_problem.txt - staged
(d) README.md - modified
	fun_problem.txt - modified
(e) README.md - staged
	fun_problem.txt - unmodified
	fun_problem.txt is now empy becuase that is how our file is on github.
(f) README.md is now modified becuase it was never
 	commited before adding onto it

Problem #6
	All the functions have a runtime theta(1). Since we have a pointer to the tail we immediately know where to go to add, to pop, and to return the top. In addition the empty function is just a direct comparison with size and zero.
